# Unit 3 Final Project: Guess the Youtuber

<strong>Description</strong>

Guess the Youtuber is a game in which a zoomed in picture of a youtuber shows up on the screen. The first person to hit the button
which will 'space' when only used on the computer, has a chance to guess the Youtuber, if they get it correctly they get a point,
however if they get it wrong the other person gets a chance to guess. If the player gets it correctly, they get a point. However, 
if neither of the players get it correctly, no one gets a point and the game moves on to the next round. 

<strong>Inspiration</strong>

My inspiration for this project was the challenge that goes around youtube in which the players get the chance to guess the youtber,
just like it works in this project. I enjoy watching these kind of challenges because most of the time I like to play along to test my knowledg but also to see how to players perform in the challenge. 

<strong>Interaction</strong>

The interaction comes into this project with the button which is pressed to get a turn to guess. By pressing the button, it indicates the program that a player is ready to enter an answer which will bring up a text box. With a makey makey, I will be able to make a button to indicate which player gets a chance to answer, as well as a sound to go with the button.
