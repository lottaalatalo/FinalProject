# Unit 3 Final Project: Guess the Youtuber

<strong>Description</strong>

Guess the Youtuber is a game in which a zoomed in picture of a youtuber shows up on the screen. The first person to hit the button
which will 'space' when only used on the computer, has a chance to guess the Youtuber, if they get it correctly they get a point,
however if they get it wrong the other person gets a chance to guess. If the player gets it correctly, they get a point. However, 
if neither of the players get it correctly, no one gets a point and the game moves on to the next round.
